Welcome to my portfolio! It's not much, but it is where I maintain and practice my coding, and it is where I express my creativity in front-end design. Thanks to HTML5 UP for this free template.
Original -> The originial structure of the code is found in HTML5 UP, hyperscpace by aj@lkn, but most of the code you'll find in this project (Florenz's Portfolio) is edited and programmed by me.
